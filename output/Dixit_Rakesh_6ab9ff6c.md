Introduction to Bispecific Antibodies
cid139 1958 The Foundation of Innovation Noble Prize winning work by Rodney Porter
with the structure of immunoglobulin
Two almost identical antigen binding Fabs nurtured the idea of artificially
constructing bispecific antibody
cid139 19601997 Over 150 publications with Five International Conferences on
Bispecific Antibodies describing various targets engineering and CMC
innovations however
Tremendous excitement but not a single approved bispecific antibody yet
e dous c te t but ot a s g app o ed b spec body yet
poor yield stability high toxicity and efficacy in clinical trials of early
bispecific Mabs

Opportunities
Bispecific mAb
Combination of mAbs
cid139 Design flexibility with various formats able
to combine multiple targets
cid139 Highly specific and effective targeting
cid139 High avidity like target interactions
allowing better efficacy
cid139 Toxicity can be reduced by engineering
differential potency in one mAb
cid139 Convenience of dosing and
flexibility with dosing schedule
simultaneous sequential etc
to reduce toxicities
cid139 Fixed combinations with
enhanced efficacy and reduced
toxicities are potentially
attainable
cid139 Cost of one mAb vs combining two
separate expensive mAbs will be
substantially less and attractive to payers
cid139 Business case for combining
two expensive antibodies can
only be made in terminal
cancers or other debilitating
diseases with very few options

Targeting different MOAs to achieve
broader efficacy
cid139 Opportunities to manage
resistance mechanisms
Resistance and escape pathways
cid139 Opportunities to improve
therapeutic index by adjusting the
ratio of antibodies in the mixture
cid139 Fixed ratio of antibodies mixture may
not allow flexibility in doses and
schedules of individual monotherapy
cid139 May enhance toxicities of mixture
single target antibodies with
overlapping DLTs
cid139 Substantial CMC and manufacturing
challenges
cid139 Business case for mixture of
antibodies is most favorable in terminal
cancers or difficult to treat infections

Disproportionate binding to one
target vs other sink effect
dependent on target expression
Reduced FcRn recycling due to
bulky structures
Altered tissue distribution leading to
decrease in circulating plasma
levels
Case Studies of Bispecific Antibodies

EGFR x IGFR Bispecific
A Novel MultiMechanistic Monoclonal Antibody Format for
Treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections
A bispecific PslxPcrV antibody for the treatment of
P aerigunosa infections Key messages
cid139 We used a phenotypic
targetindependent
approach including the
use of Bcells
convalescing patients to
identify functionally active
antibodies against a
novel epitope Psl on the
surface of P aerigunosa
cid139 We developed a novel
bispecific format to
generate a drug
candidate that is superior
to an oligoclonal
approach for treatment of
P aerigunosa infections
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bispecific
Background
cid139 Pseudomonas aeruginosa
It is a Gramnegative aerobic rodshaped bacterium with unipolar motility
An opportunistic human pathogen P aeruginosa is also of
plants
P aeruginosa is often preliminarily identified by its pearlescent appearance and
grapelike or tortillalike odor in vitro
grape like or tortilla odor in vitro
P aeruginosa is capable of growth in diesel and jet fuel where it known as a
hydrocarbonusing microorganism or HUM bug causing microbial corrosion
An opportunistic nosocomial pathogen of immunocompromised individuals P
aeruginosa typically infects the pulmonary tract urinary burns wounds and also
causes other blood infections
cid139 Unmet Medical Need Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ventilator
Associated Pneumonia VAP
Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of death from hospitalacquired infections
Nearly 13 of patients intubated for 48 hr or more develop VAP
Patients with VAP due to P aeruginosa have an attributable mortality 40
20 of PA isolates from US ICUs were resistant to imipenem and 30
resistant to fluorquinolones
AntiPcrVPsl Combination Multispecific Rationale
PcrV Virulence factor
MOA Prevents toxin injection into host cells
High affinity mAb to low density target
Potential to engage both surface targets with
mAbs having unique MOAs without competition
Expression of both targets is coordinated but in
opposite directions
96 of strains express either or both targets
Psl Persistence factor
MOA Promotes opsonophagocytic killing and
blocks cell adherence
Low affinity mAb to high density target

Executive Summary
cid139 Novel bispecific antibody provides
Protection against multiple pathogenic activities of P aeruginosa
Broad P aeruginosa coverage independent of serotype or antibiotic
resistance
Potent efficacy in several different prevention and treatment infection models
Synergistic activity when combined with antibiotics
Low safety concerns due to absence of host cell target
Lack of disruption beneficial microbiome or promotion antibiotic
resistance
High expression level excellent thermostability with strong protease
resistance
cid139 Can be developed for prevention or treatment
Both TPPs are commercially viable
Additional information required to choose between strategic alternatives
Same IND filing and Phase 1 regardless of strategy

Conclusions
cid139 Novel bispecific mAbs offer a great promise in maximizing the potential of
combination biologicstargets through a single mAb
combination biologicstargets thro gh a single mAb
cid139 Smart engineering approaches are needed to optimize valency potency
avidity and halflife of bispecific IgG like mAbs to attain the best efficacy
combination biologics therapies
cid139 To minimize toxicity potentiation additive or synergistic resulting from the
simultaneous hit of two targets or redirected effector cells with
overlapping toxicities should be avoided or affinitiespotencies
reengineered to minimize low dose toxicities
cid139 On and offtarget toxicities PKPD resulting from the modulation of two
targets should be carefully evaluated very early in drug development
